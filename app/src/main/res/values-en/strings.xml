Then He brings them together, then He makes them into a mass, and you see the rain emerge from within it.

That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know.{30}[Adhere to it], turning in repentance to Him, and fear Him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associate others with Allah{31}[Or] of those who have divided their religion and become sects, every faction rejoicing in what it has.{32}And when adversity touches the people, they call upon their Lord, turning in repentance to Him. Then when He lets them taste mercy from Him, at once a party of them associate others with their Lord,{33}So that they will deny what We have granted them. Then enjoy yourselves, for you are going to know.{34}Or have We sent down to them an authority, and it speaks of what they were associating with Him?{35}And when We let the people taste mercy, they rejoice therein, but if evil afflicts them for what their hands have put forth, immediately they despair.{36}Do they not see that Allah extends provision for whom He wills and restricts [it]? Indeed, in that are signs for a people who believe.{37}So give the relative his right, as well as the needy and the traveler. That is best for those who desire the countenance of Allah, and it is they who will be the successful.{38}And whatever you give for interest to increase within the wealth of people will not increase with Allah. But what you give in zakah, desiring the countenance of Allah - those are the multipliers.{39}Allah is the one who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die, and then will give you life. Are there any of your "partners" who does anything of that? Exalted is He and high above what they associate with Him.{40}Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by [reason of] what the hands of people have earned so He may let them taste part of [the consequence of] what they have done that perhaps they will return [to righteousness].{41}Say, [O Muhammad], "Travel through the land and observe how was the end of those before. Most of them were associators [of others with Allah].{42}So direct your face toward the correct religion before a Day comes from Allah of which there is no repelling. That Day, they will be divided.{43}Whoever disbelieves - upon him is [the consequence of] his disbelief. And whoever does righteousness - they are for themselves preparing,{44}That He may reward those who have believed and done righteous deeds out of His bounty. Indeed, He does not like the disbelievers.{45}And of His signs is that He sends the winds as bringers of good tidings and to let you taste His mercy and so the ships may sail at His command and so you may seek of His bounty, and perhaps you will be grateful.{46}And We have already sent messengers before you to their peoples, and they came to them with clear evidences; then We took retribution from those who committed crimes, and incumbent upon Us was support of the believers.{47}It is Allah who sends the winds, and they stir the clouds and spread them in the sky however He wills, and He makes them fragments so you see the rain emerge from within them. And when He causes it to fall upon whom He wills of His servants, immediately they rejoice{48}Although they were, before it was sent down upon them - before that, in despair.{49}So observe the effects of the mercy of Allah - how He gives life to the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed, that [same one] will give life to the dead, and He is over all things competent.{50}But if We should send a [bad] wind and they saw [their crops] turned yellow, they would remain thereafter disbelievers.{51}So indeed, you will not make the dead hear, nor will you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs, retreating.{52}And you cannot guide the blind away from their error. You will only make hear those who believe in Our verses so they are Muslims [in submission to Allah].{53}Allah is the one who created you from weakness, then made after weakness strength, then made after strength weakness and white hair. He creates what He wills, and He is the Knowing, the Competent.{54}And the Day the Hour appears the criminals will swear they had remained but an hour. Thus they were deluded.{55}But those who were given knowledge and faith will say, "You remained the extent of Allah \'s decree until the Day of Resurrection, and this is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not used to know."{56}So that Day, their excuse will not benefit those who wronged, nor will they be asked to appease [Allah].{57}And We have certainly presented to the people in this Qur'an from every [kind of] example. But, [O Muhammad], if you should bring them a sign, the disbelievers will surely say, "You [believers] are but falsifiers."{58}Thus does Allah seal the hearts of those who do not know.{59}So be patient. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And let them not disquiet you who are not certain [in faith].{60}</string>

    <string name="an1biaa1_6" >[The time of] their account has approached for the people, while they are in heedlessness turning away.{1}No mention comes to them anew from their Lord except that they listen to it while they are at play{2}With their hearts distracted. And those who do wrong conceal their private conversation, [saying], "Is this [Prophet] except a human being like you? So would you approach magic while you are aware [of it]?"{3}The Prophet said, "My Lord knows whatever is said throughout the heaven and earth, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing."{4}But they say, "[The revelation is but] a mixture of false dreams; rather, he has invented it; rather, he is a poet.

Exalted is He! Rather, they are [but] honored servants.{26}They cannot precede Him in word, and they act by His command.{27}He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves.

Indeed, he is of the wrongdoers."{59}They said, "We heard a young man mention them who is called Abraham."{60}They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people that they may testify."{61}They said, "Have you done this to our gods, O Abraham?"{62}He said, "Rather, this - the largest of them - did it, so ask them, if they should [be able to] speak."{63}So they returned to [blaming] themselves and said [to each other], "Indeed, you are the wrongdoers."{64}Then they reversed themselves, [saying], "You have already known that these do not speak!"{65}He said, "Then do you worship instead of Allah that which does not benefit you at all or harm you?{66}Uff to you and to what you worship instead of Allah. Then will you not use reason?"{67}They said, "Burn him and support your gods - if you are to act."{68}Allah said, "O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham."{69}And they intended for him harm, but We made them the greatest losers.{70}And We delivered him and Lot to the land which We had blessed for the worlds.{71}And We gave him Isaac and Jacob in addition, and all [of them] We made righteous.{72}And We made them leaders guiding by Our command. And We inspired to them the doing of good deeds, establishment of prayer, and giving of zakah; and they were worshippers of Us.{73}</string>

And We were doing [that].{79}And We taught him the fashioning of coats of armor to protect you from your [enemy in] battle. So will you then be grateful?{80}And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind, blowing forcefully, proceeding by his command toward the land which We had blessed.
